# stackimages
A simple Python script to stack two images next to each other.

## Before use:
You need to have Python installed. On Windows 10 you can get this from the Microsoft Store. 
Once Python is installed you need to install the "Pillow" library. Open Command Prompt/Terminal and run the command `pip install Pillow`.

Create two subfolders in the same folder as the script - one called `input` and one called `output`.

## To use:
Place photos to be combined in the `input` folder. On Windows, double-click on the `stackimages.bat` file. 
Combined photos will be created in the `output` folder.
